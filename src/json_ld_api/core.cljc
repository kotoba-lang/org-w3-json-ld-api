  "JSON-LD 1.1 expansion — [W3C REC](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/).

   Third layer of the `-rdfc-` cryptosuite stack. `org-w3-rdf-canon` canonicalizes an
   RDF dataset; a Verifiable Credential is a JSON-LD document, and expansion is what
   turns its context-dependent shorthand into the explicit form RDF conversion needs.
   Without it, `eddsa-rdfc-2022` has nothing to canonicalize.

   ## Contexts are never fetched, and that is a security property

   `expand` does no network I/O. A remote `@context` must be supplied in
   `:contexts` (a url -> context map); an unsupplied one throws
   `:json-ld/context-not-provided`.

   This is deliberate. A `@context` decides what every term in a document *means*,
   so a verifier that fetches one at verification time hands the context's host the
   power to change what a signature covers — after it was signed, with no key and no
   detectable tampering. The document would still verify, against a different graph.
   Pinning contexts is the only way the meaning of a signed document stays fixed, so
   this library cannot be configured to fetch. (It also removes verification's
   dependence on someone else's uptime, but that is the lesser reason.)

   ## What is implemented, and what refuses rather than guesses

   Implemented: context processing (`@base`, `@vocab`, `@version`, `@protected`,
   term definitions with `@id`/`@type`/`@container`/`@language`/`@prefix`/`@reverse`,
   property- and type-scoped contexts, context nullification), IRI expansion, value
   expansion, and the expansion algorithm over node objects, value objects, arrays,
   `@list`, `@set`, `@graph`, `@id`, `@type`, `@language`, `@index` and `@reverse`,
   including dropping free-floating nodes.

   **Not implemented, and each throws rather than being ignored:** `@nest`, `@json`
   type coercion, `@import`, `@propagate`, `@included`, `@direction`, and the
   `@container` variants `@index`/`@id`/`@type`.

   Throwing matters more here than in most libraries. A processor that quietly
   ignored `@nest` would return an expansion that is missing triples, and the
   caller's next step is to *sign* it — so the failure would surface as a signature
   over a graph nobody intended, not as an error. Every refusal below carries the
   spec's own error code so a caller can tell a limit from a malformed document.

   ## `expand` is NOT a validator

   Measured against the official suite, **24 of its 103 malformed documents are
   still accepted rather than refused** (the exact list prints when the suite runs).
   So a successful `expand` does not mean the input was valid JSON-LD. Do not use it
   as an admission check on untrusted input; validate separately, and treat
   expansion as a transformation that may succeed on garbage.

   ## Correctness is measured against the official suite

   `test/fixtures/` holds the entire W3C JSON-LD 1.1 expansion test suite — 276
   positive and 109 negative cases — committed so the suite needs no network. The
   negative cases check the *error code*, not merely that something was raised.

   Current standing, pinned as a floor so it can only improve:

       positive: 107/273 exact match  (98 refused as unsupported, 54 mismatch)
       negative:  50/103 exact code   (24 accepted that should have been refused)

   The suite percentage is not the useful number, though. What told me this library
   would refuse *every real Verifiable Credential* was expanding one: credentials/v2
   puts `@container: @graph` on `proof` and declares `@json` on three terms no
   credential touches, and my refusals were placed at context-processing time. A
   pass rate cannot surface that; `a-real-verifiable-credential-expands` can."

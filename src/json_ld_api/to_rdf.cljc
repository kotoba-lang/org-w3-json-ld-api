  "Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF — [JSON-LD 1.1 API §7](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithms).

   The step between expansion and canonicalization. `json-ld-api.core/expand` produces
   expanded JSON-LD; `rdf-canon` canonicalizes an RDF dataset; this turns the former
   into the latter, so a Verifiable Credential can finally reach a canonical hash.

   Returns statements in `nquads.core` shape, which is what `rdf-canon` consumes
   directly — no intermediate serialization, so there is nowhere for a spelling
   difference to creep in between the two layers.

   ## Numbers are where this algorithm bites

   A JSON number has no datatype; RDF demands one, and §7.4 fixes the choice and the
   *lexical form*. An integral value becomes `xsd:integer` with its plain digits, and
   anything else becomes `xsd:double` in XSD canonical form — `1.0E0`, not `1.0`,
   `1`, or `1.0e0`. That form is mandatory rather than cosmetic: the string is what
   gets hashed, so `1.0` and `1.0E0` are different signatures over the same number.

   The boundary is 1e21: at or above it a value is a double even when integral,
   because JSON's own `toString` switches to exponential there.

   ## What is dropped, deliberately, and what that costs

   RDF cannot express everything expanded JSON-LD can, and §7 says to *drop* the
   excess rather than fail:

   - a relative IRI in the subject, predicate or object position — it has no
     absolute form, so there is no term to emit;
   - a blank node as a predicate, unless `:produce-generalized-rdf?` is set, since
     RDF proper has no such triple.

   Dropping is the spec's instruction, but it means **the RDF is not always a
   faithful image of the JSON-LD**. A document can lose statements here and still
   canonicalize and sign cleanly. That is a property of the pipeline, not a bug in
   this namespace, and it is why a signature over canonical RDF attests to the
   *dataset*, not to the JSON that produced it."

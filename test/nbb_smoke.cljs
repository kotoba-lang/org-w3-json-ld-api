;; nbb smoke test — proves the :cljs branches are real, and agree with the JVM.
;;
;; This file exists because `to-rdf` formats NUMBERS per host, and the string it
;; produces is what gets hashed and signed. The two platforms disagree natively —
;; the JVM writes `1.0E0` where JavaScript writes `1e+0` — so `double-lexical`
;; assembles the XSD canonical form by hand on both. If it were wrong on one of them,
;; a credential signed on the JVM would not verify in a browser and nothing else
;; would notice: `json-ld-api` had NO cljs verification at all until this file.
;;
;; Every expected value below was measured on the JVM first and is pinned
;; identically here. Whichever host is wrong, one of the two runs fails.

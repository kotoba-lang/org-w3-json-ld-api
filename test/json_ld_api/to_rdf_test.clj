  "Scored against the official W3C JSON-LD 1.1 toRdf test suite, committed under
   test/fixtures/ so the suite needs no network.

   These cases run expansion AND conversion together, so an expansion gap caps this
   score too — the number below is a joint measure of both namespaces, not of this
   one alone.

   Comparison is on the CANONICAL form of both sides, via rdf-canon. Comparing raw
   N-Quads text would fail on nothing but blank node labels and statement order,
   neither of which carries meaning; comparing canonical forms asks the question that
   matters, which is whether the two datasets are the same graph."
